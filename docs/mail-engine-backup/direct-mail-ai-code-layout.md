# Direct Mail AI — Code Layout

*Module structure and the interface signatures not already fixed by the service contract document. Python-flavored; translates 1:1 to TypeScript if that matches the NMC stack better.*

Dependency rule (enforced by imports, checkable in review): `web` and `jobs` → `service` → `derivation`/`resolution` → `domain`. `seams` is imported only by `jobs` and `service/execution`. Nothing imports upward. `db.readonly` is importable from anywhere (it can't write).

## Signatures not yet fixed elsewhere

### derivation/rules.py — pure functions, no I/O

```python
RULESET_VERSION: str  # bump on any definition change; recorded on snapshots

def derive_stage(events: list[Event], flags: ContactFlags) -> contact_stage: ...
def is_responded(events: list[Event]) -> bool: ...
def quiet_days(events: list[Event], as_of: date) -> int | None: ...
def is_suppressed(events: list[Event], flags: ContactFlags) -> bool: ...
```

Pure `events -> judgment`, no database access. This is what makes full-history
recomputation trivial and the definitions unit-testable with fixture lists.
`recompute_state` in the service layer does the I/O and calls these.

### seams/print_api.py

```python
class PrintApi(Protocol):
    def verify_address(self, addr: Address) -> AddressVerdict: ...
    def submit_piece(self, piece: Piece, creative: Creative) -> SubmissionResult: ...
    def parse_webhook(self, raw: bytes, headers: dict) -> Event: ...
        # vendor payload -> canonical taxonomy event; vendor names never leak upward
    def cost_estimate(self, spec: PieceSpec, qty: int) -> Money: ...
```

`LobClient` implements it; a `PostGridClient` later is a new file, zero changes above.

### seams/response_feed.py

```python
class ResponseFeed(Protocol):
    source: event_source
    def pull_events(self, since: datetime) -> Iterator[Event]: ...
        # yields canonical events with external_id set (idempotency key);
        # attribution fields best-effort (mailer code if present, else null)
```

`PostHogFeed` and `NmcFeed` both implement it. NMC gets no special access
despite being our own product — same contract, same discipline.

### judgment/protocol.py

```python
class Rule(Protocol):
    name: str            # 'quiet_reengage' — appears in nudge payloads verbatim
    priority: int        # digest ranking; lower = first
    recipient: Recipient # DEAL_OWNER | YOUNG

    def evaluate(self, ro: ReadOnlyDB, params: Params, as_of: date) -> list[Hit]: ...

@dataclass
class Hit:
    contact_id: UUID | None   # None for roll-ups (orphan_events, wave_anomaly)
    wave_id: UUID | None
    facts: dict               # what matched — becomes the audit answer to "why?"
```

One rule per file in `judgment/rules/`; the job discovers and runs all of them.
Adding a rule = adding a file. No registry to update.

### judgment/composer.py

```python
def compose_brief(hit: Hit, timeline: list[Event], rule: Rule) -> str: ...
    # AI call; MUST return within timeout or raise — caller falls back:
def template_brief(hit: Hit, rule: Rule) -> str: ...
    # always succeeds; delivery never depends on the model
```

### jobs/nightly.py — the one orchestration

```python
def run_nightly() -> None:
    for feed in feeds: sync(feed)          # facts in
    service.execution.recompute_state()    # judgments refreshed
    judgment.run(as_of=today)              # nudges out
    # strict order; a sync failure halts before recompute — never judge stale state
```

## What deliberately has no class

No `Campaign` aggregate object, no repository pattern, no domain-event bus. The
database rows plus the verb modules ARE the model; adding an object layer between
them at this scale is ceremony. The three interfaces above exist only where a
real substitution or a real fallback exists (vendor swap, feed addition, model
outage) — the encapsulation standard applied honestly: seams where variation is
real, none where it's speculative.
